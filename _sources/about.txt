PiFace Digital
##############
PiFace Digital has eight inputs, eight outputs, eight LED's, two relays and
four switches.

Outputs
=======
The eight output pins are located at the top of the board (near the LED's). The
outputs are open collectors; they can be thought of as switches connecting to
ground. This offers greater flexibility since the PiFace can control devices
that operate using different voltages. The ninth pin provides 5V for connecting
circuits to.

An example circuit is (**R**esistor, **L**ED, **O**utput pin, **5**V pin)::

     +-R-L--+
    OOOOOOOO5

The LED's are connected in parallel to each of the outputs. This means that
when you set output pin 4 high, LED 4 illuminates.

The two Relays are connected in paralley to output pins 0 and 1 respectively.
When you set output pin 0 high, LED 0 illuminated and Relay 0 activates. When
activated, the relay bridges the top and middle pins. When deactivated the
bottom two are connected.

Relay activated::

    [Top Pin   ]
    [Common    ]
     Bottom Pin

Relay Deactivated::

     Top Pin
    [Common    ]
    [Bottom Pin]

Inputs
======
The eight input pins detect a connection to ground (provided as the ninth pin).
The four switches are connected in parallel to the first four input pins. The
inputs are *pulled up* to 5V. This can be turned off so that the inputs float.
